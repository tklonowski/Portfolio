<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 25 year old Software Engineer who lives in the Buffalo area. I have had the privilege to work for both small and large companies in the private and public sectors. My current passion is .NET development in C#, specifically MVC. I haven’t always been a .NET developer though. </p>

<p>More to come when construction is closer to complete.</p>
